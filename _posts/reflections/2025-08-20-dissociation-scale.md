5 — Completely/painfully disconnected from reality.  
Examples: Intoxicated; the very groggiest middle of the night wake up; fainting; dreaming.  
Description: The present feels completely unreal, time doesn't exist, I completely lack any emotional confidence that my “memory” of the immediate past is what just happened. Sometimes this makes me actually feel that things aren't real, which is deeply uncomfortable; usually, I can work with Sherlock's “the only possibility, how ever improbable” 😃

4 — Overwhelmingly disconnected from reality.  
Example: Bumping into family member in public on a bad day and barely recognising them.  
Description: The present feels overwhelmingly foggy, time is confusing, the “Did that just happen?” feeling is overwhelming.

3 — Badly disconnected from reality.  
Examples: When I'm pacing; when I miss whole episodes of tv.  
Description: The present feels bad, time passes without my consent, memories of the immediate past feel the same way. 

2 — Disconnected from reality.  
Most of the time on most days.  
Description: The present feels foggy. Recall is kind of difficult. Memories feel emotionally/personally disconnected. 

1 — Connected to reality.  
Examples: Spending time with friends on good days in person, things like playing games together and going to the beach; looking into my partner's eyes.
Description: Feels like I'm actually seeing what's around me in full colour.
