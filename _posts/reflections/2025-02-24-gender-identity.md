"what is a woman?" i don't know. 

here are some of *my personal thoughts* about a thing called "sex" or "gender", or two things called "sex" and "gender". i'm not very familiar with other people's thoughts (probably less than i should be).

i am not trying to come across as presumptuous or hostile if read by someone who doesn't know or understand or agree!!! i am sharing specifically for their benefit <3 

please read to the end... i just had to pick some order to write down thoughts in, the intended experience is for you to read all of them.

# sex
"sex" is... something external? ways people characterise sex include:
- a person's sex is strictly about their reproductive role (the people they can reproduce with).
- a person's sex is strictly about their external reproductive organ.
- a person's sex is strictly about their genes.
- a person's sex is associated with a wide array of different physical features.
- a person's sex is associated with features of their brain structure and activity, according to some studies.

# gender
"gender" is... something internal? ways people characterise gender include:
- a person's gender is strictly the word that's the same as their sex.

- a person's gender is strictly something they know about themselves. (this feeling is "real" enough that it has been seen on brain scans: when seeing themselves or someone else, their brain activity is different when they recognise/relate compared to when they don't.)

- a person's gender is associated with the way they want to be perceived and go through life, e.g. being treated like other people of their gender are treated. (being perceived incorrectly (misgendered) is usually associated with severe distress (dysphoria).)

- a person's gender is associated with most of the things they do ("performing gender"), including things like the clothes and hairstyles they wear, the words they use to describe themselves, and the work they do.

(the next and final sections are incomplete and contain all unfinished thoughts.)

# intersex and non-binary gender
even though neither physical or mental characteristics actually come in binary classifications, humans love classifying things anyway, and language would be much harder if we didn't... for this reason, we often only talk about the two most common sexes and use the term "intersex" for everyone else (up to 2% of people, according to a study). we often only talk about the two most common genders and use the term "non-binary" for everyone else (0.34% of people didn't select a binary gender in the most recent English census).

individually: none of them describe only two options. not all of them actually make sense. 

as a group: they are different and don't necessarily agree with each other. 

these ideas naturally mean there is an indefinite and unlimited number of different sexes and genders in humans, because different people are different, occasionally significantly so. still, we associate these ideas and they reinforce each other. 

we make generalisations and assumptions because we have to get through the day somehow! assuming a particular person with an unknown number of arms has two arms is very different from making universal assertions that people who don't have two arms don't exist (and this is still very different from making it illegal or impossible for them to live with the very real things that means for them). 

# transgender
we live in a society. sex and gender are so universally and deeply associated that many of us have fully internalised the idea these are many aspects of a single strict binary classification where the words "sex" and "gender" are synonyms. in particular, sex and gender are not only assumed, but they're also assumed to match.

sex is really a less common word to use and even academics might say things like "physical gender presentation" instead.

a point that occurs to me is that a question of existence or possibility is definitively answered by a single example. there's still a question of what words to use for this thing. perhaps some would be more comfortable with the idea of gender being something not associated with sex, and e.g. a word other than 'woman' being used for people with a certain gender. but this isn't the society we live in. sex and gender are strrongly associatted.

what does it mean to recognise someone's real gender? why are people with different genders treated differently anyway? why is there segregation of bathrooms and sports? should gender be seen as something different from physical sex? can it?

some people's internal mental body maps don't match their physical body (like amputees having phantom limb sensations) (which is associated with feelings of distress)

what about other things and analogies and silly things people say?

"trans height"? is it possible for someone to have a height in their brain? no...! height isn't a mental characteristic. "trans race"? actually possibly exists, idfk what race is.

i'm comparing it to identity disorders ('multiple personalities'). is it possible for someone to have an identity in their brain? yes...! they obviously don't have separate physical bodies, but these words don't mean that they do.

# my gender
the feelings i have aren't the same all the time. 

"i am a woman" like "i am a mathematician", it's a part of my identity that arises from experience, im always one even though im not always actively one and im always a man too.

basically i feel differently at different times and i want to express that and be seen as how i am 😊

A thing that happens is I slowly feel different feelings but don't feel ready to switch the way I recognise it so there's some days I just don't have words for
