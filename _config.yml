###########################################################
### Welcome to Jekyll!
###
### This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole website, values
### which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
### yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
### feature for the data you need to update frequently.
###
### For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
### 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
###
### If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:
### https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/#yaml
### https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/
###
### If you look in the HTML files, you will see these settings accessed via 
### {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on. You can create any 
### custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible 
### in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
