i [dissociate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology)) a lot. i don't have any diagnoses (i've never got any mental healthcare lol) but i have symptoms of a [dissociative disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_disorder) called [depersonalisation-derealisation disorder (DpDr)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder). i made a [dissociation scale](/2025-08-20-dissociation-scale) to compare good days and bad days.
