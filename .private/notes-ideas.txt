🏠 Homepage:
a little welcome blurb that feels like you (“Hi, I’m Luca — this is my corner of the internet 💫”)
a cute selfie or two
quick links to your social places (discord handle, reddit, etc.)
maybe a quote or motto that fits your energy

📜 About / Fun Facts page:
like a personality snapshot — a mix of “about me”, gender/identity, interests, favourite things
could have sections like “Current obsessions,” “Things I believe,” “Tiny bio”

🧠 Reflections / Journal page:
this is where you’d keep personal essays, gender thoughts, or reflections — maybe with dates, but still easy to browse
could be organized by topic instead of just chronologically (e.g. Gender & Expression, Self-Care, Philosophy, Random musings)

💋 Gallery / Selfies page:
maybe divided into “everyday”, “feminine looks”, “glam”, etc.
this could even link out to your guns.lol or Pixieset gallery if you don’t want to host them all

💭 Links / Projects / Misc page:
cool stuff you’re doing, pages you like, maybe even a “resources I recommend” list
totally flexible — could change over time without disrupting your main structure

beauty? fitness? routines?
body journey? hair care?
