🏠 Homepage:
a little welcome blurb that feels like you (“Hi, I’m Luca — this is my corner of the internet 💫”)
a cute selfie or two
quick links to your social places (discord handle, reddit, etc.)
maybe a quote or motto that fits your energy

📜 About / Fun Facts page:
like a personality snapshot — a mix of “about me”, gender/identity, interests, favourite things
could have sections like “Current obsessions,” “Things I believe,” “Tiny bio”

💭 Links / Projects / Misc page:
cool stuff you’re doing, pages you like, maybe even a “resources I recommend” list
totally flexible — could change over time without disrupting your main structure

"aesthetic and transformation" category content/word associations: fitness, beauty, routine, any activities and changes, femininity, the journey of shaping yourself, body journey, hair care, growth, self-care

chatGPT text colours:
#403b3d (muted charcoal for readability)
#404040 (the one Beautiful Jekyll already uses — nice balance)
#4a3f48 (a slightly warmer, mauve-tinted dark grey — feminine without being “pink”)
#5a4c58 (a dusty lilac-taupe tone that looks gorgeous with pastel accents)

ChatGPT wrote these lines about personality in my intro in response to this prompt
"My masculine energy is definitely medium soft, you know, I'm still a person who has feminine days! I'm very sincere and I love building up my bros, you know, stuff like that. I'm definitely quite shy. I have a bunch of masculine bro energy, just totally in a soft way. Your suggestion of being a bit more direct is fair too, but really just a bit."
• I’m pretty soft-spoken and a bit shy, but I love getting to know people.  
• I switch between masc and femme energy depending on the day, and I’m comfortable with both.  
• I’m big on sincerity, hyping up my friends, and trying to be good to the people around me.  

Then we start adding:
- colour palette 
- lowercase/sentence-case shift 
- emoji switch 
- button design and press 
- maybe a smoother toggle animation 
- theme-aware transitions
