theme: minima
title: lola’s world
description: reflections, routines & random thoughts 💋
show_excerpts: true
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About: pages/about.md
  - Beauty: pages/beauty.md
  - Fitness: pages/fitness.md
  - Journal: / # links to your blog feed
not all themes support nav: natively, but minima can do a basic navbar with a tiny tweak — or you can add a custom _includes/header.html to display these links manually.
