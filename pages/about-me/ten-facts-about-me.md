title:  "ten facts about me"
---

1. my gender is fun and exciting and makes me feel happy! i love that it's not the same all the time and i really love that it's whatever i want. i love the feeling of feeling a lot of gender. for example i love doing very gendered things (like putting on make up), especially trying new things. and i love the days my gender feelings shift

1. i'm TRYING to develop a sense of style (who decided clothes should cost money??) and i need at least two aesthetics... pink is my favourite colour (can you tell?)

1. i think and talk about maths for fun :) i focused quite a lot on "modern algebra" at university (calculus people are my natural enemy). i do most of my maths on reddit, i also used to be a maths tutor

1. i'm in a wonderful (and very long distance) relationship with my wonderful (although american) partner. we're open, but i'm not really looking for things with new people (but i'm kind of the slutty kinky friend 🫶🏻)

1. i spend a lot of time meeting new people online. 

1. i'm currently unemployed and still living with my parents. it's common for time to pass without me noticing, and i quite often don't get to do things that i want or need to do. sometimes even conversation passes me by and i don't really have thoughts abt things. i've never got mental healthcare but tests available online "diagnose" me with autism, ADHD and DpDr. some days feel pretty bad, but oh well <3

1. i also just kind of lack common sense. to make me feel pretty about it, i choose to say i'm a ✨bimbo✨!

1. i like games i guess, but i've mostly played runescape a lot lol! i love story based games, star wars kotor is very special to me (a super boring, popular opinion hehe). i played dnd with my friends ONCE (the pain of making plans as an adult...). i've been enjoying overwatch recently (specifically because i heard femboys playing it is a thing and i wanted to try it and try to make friends!)

1. i go to the gym 5 days a week (when i can afford a membership), it's my happy place! i love the community + the gym fits + ARM DAY BEST DAY (don't worry i'm not a leg day skipper)

1. i'm a disgusting optimist and i ✨love✨ that smiling makes you happy (did you know?). my partner helps me to appreciate nature and sunlight (:
