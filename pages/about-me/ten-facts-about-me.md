1. my gender is fun and exciting and makes me feel happy! i love that it's not the same all the time and i really love that it's whatever i want. i love the feeling of feeling a lot of gender. for example i love when i do very gendered things (like putting on make up), especially trying new things. and i love the days my gender feelings shift.

1. i'm kiiind of still trying to find an aesthetic (: pink is my favourite colour n i like cute things! very much wish clothes didn't COST MONEY, i need to try more!

1. i'm a maths tutor and i also think and talk about maths for fun. i focused quite a lot on "modern algebra" at university (calculus people are my natural enemy). these days i do most of my maths on reddit...

1. i'm in a wonderful (and very long distance) relationship with my wonderful (although american) partner. we're open, but i'm not really looking for things with new people (but i'm kind of the slutty kinky friend 🫶🏻)

1. i spend a lot of time meeting new people online. 

1. i've never got mental healthcare but google tests "diagnose" me with autism, ADHD and DpDr. it's common for time to pass without me noticing, and i quite often don't get to do things that i want or need to do. this feels pretty bad when i think about it or when i'm having a bad day. sometimes even conversation passes me by and i don't really have thoughts abt things. 

1. i lack common sense, so to make me feel pretty about it, i choose to say i'm a ✨bimbo✨!

1. i like games. i've mostly played runescape a lot. i like story based games. i played dnd with my friends ONCE (the pain of making plans as an adult...). i've been enjoying overwatch recently. 

1. i go to the gym 5 days a week (when i can afford a membership), it's my happy place <3

1. i'm a disgusting optimist and i ✨love✨ that smiling makes you happy (did you know?). my partner helps me to appreciate nature and sunlight (:
