title:  "Ten facts about me"
---

1. My gender is fun and exciting and makes me feel happy! <span class="emoji2" /> I love that it's not the same all the time and I really love that it's whatever I want. I love the feeling of feeling a lot of gender, like when I do very gendered things (like wearing make up), especially trying new things, and I love the days my gender feelings shift

1. I'm currently unemployed and still living with my parents. It's common for time to pass without me noticing, and I quite often don't get to do things that I want or need to do. I've never got mental healthcare but tests available online "diagnose" me with <span class="preserve-case">autism, ADHD and DpDr</span>

1. Did you know that smiling makes you happy? That's my <span class="preserve-case">FAVOURITE</span> fact, and (alongside hugs from friends) it always makes me feel better on my bad days! <span class="emoji1" /> I also love the sun and the sky and the way my partner helps me to appreciate things

1. I kind of lack common sense but <span class="preserve-case">DON'T WORRY</span> because it's totally in a fun, pretty, bimbo way. Thoughts are so difficult and I'm literally fine without them anyway! <span class="emoji2" />

1. I'm <span class="preserve-case">TRYING</span> to develop a sense of style (who decided clothes should cost money??)... Pink is my favourite colour (can you tell?) and I love the bimbo aesthetic, but I also love a more basic aesthetic just as much! Long fabulous nails are mandatory but other than that, of course one aesthetic can't be enough for me, so in summary I need a whole wardrobe fml

1. I'm in a wonderful (and very long distance) relationship with my wonderful (although <span class="preserve-case">American</span>) partner. We met online 3 years ago and have visited in person a few times

1. I go to the gym 5 days a week (when I can afford a membership), it's totally my happy place! <span class="emoji2" /> I love the community + the gym fits + <span class="preserve-case">ARM DAY BEST DAY</span> (don't worry I'm not a leg day skipper)

1. I think talking to people is the best thing <span class="emoji1" /> I'm really shy with new people in person, but I spend a lot of time meeting new people online. It's nice to pass time with short conversations, but actually making friends is even better! I'm just easygoing and an open book <span class="emoji2" />

1. I think and talk about maths for fun <span class="emoji1" /> I focused quite a lot on "modern algebra" at university (calculus people are my natural enemy) and I used to do tutoring. These days I do most of my maths helping people who share questions on reddit

1. I like games I guess, but I've mostly played runescape a lot lol! I love a deep story, Star Wars KOTOR is very special to me (a super boring, popular opinion hehe). I've been enjoying Overwatch recently (specifically because I heard gender havers playing it is a thing and I wanted to try it and try to make friends!)
