title:  "ten facts about me"
---

1. my gender is fun and exciting and makes me feel happy! c: i love that it's not the same all the time and i really love that it's whatever i want. i love the feeling of feeling a lot of gender, like when i do very gendered things (like wearing make up), especially trying new things, and i love the days my gender feelings shift

1. i'm currently unemployed and still living with my parents. it's common for time to pass without me noticing, and i quite often don't get to do things that i want or need to do. i've never got mental healthcare but tests available online "diagnose" me with autism, ADHD and DpDr

1. did you know that smiling makes you happy? that's my FAVOURITE fact, and (alongside hugs from friends) it always makes me feel better on my bad days! <3 i also love the sun and the sky and the way my partner helps me to appreciate things

1. i kind of lack common sense but DON'T WORRY because it's totally in a fun, pretty, bimbo way. thoughts are so difficult and i'm literally fine without them anyway! :3

1. i'm TRYING to develop a sense of style (who decided clothes should cost money??)... pink is my favourite colour (can you tell?) and i love the bimbo aesthetic, but i also love a more basic aesthetic just as much! long fabulous nails are mandatory but other than that, of course one aesthetic can't be enough for me, so in summary i need a whole wardrobe fml

1. i'm in a wonderful (and very long distance) relationship with my wonderful (although american) partner. we met online 3 years ago and have visited in person a few times

1. i go to the gym 5 days a week (when i can afford a membership), it's totally my happy place! <3 i love the community + the gym fits + ARM DAY BEST DAY (don't worry i'm not a leg day skipper)

1. i think talking to people is the best thing <3 i'm really shy with new people in person, but i spend a lot of time meeting new people online. it's nice to pass time with short conversations, but actually making friends is even better! i'm just easygoing and an open book c:

1. i think and talk about maths for fun :) i focused quite a lot on "modern algebra" at university (calculus people are my natural enemy) and i used to do tutoring. these days i do most of my maths helping people who share questions on reddit

1. i like games i guess, but i've mostly played runescape a lot lol! i love a deep story, star wars kotor is very special to me (a super boring, popular opinion hehe). i've been enjoying overwatch recently (specifically because i heard gender havers playing it is a thing and i wanted to try it and try to make friends!)
