title:  "ten facts about me"
---

1. my gender is fun and exciting and makes me feel happy! i love that it's not the same all the time and i really love that it's whatever i want. i love the feeling of feeling a lot of gender, like when i do very gendered things (like wearing make up), especially trying new things, and i love the days my gender feelings shift

1. i'm currently unemployed and still living with my parents. it's common for time to pass without me noticing, and i quite often don't get to do things that i want or need to do. sometimes even conversation passes me by and i don't really have thoughts abt things. i've never got mental healthcare but tests available online "diagnose" me with autism, ADHD and DpDr. some days feel pretty bad, but oh well <3

1. i kind of lack common sense but DON'T WORRY because it's totally in a fun, pretty, bimbo way. thoughts are so difficult, and so overrated

1. i'm TRYING to develop a sense of style (who decided clothes should cost money??)... pink is my favourite colour (can you tell?) and i love the bimbo aesthetic, but i also love a more basic aesthetic just as much! long fabulous nails are mandatory but other than that, of course one aesthetic can't be enough for me, so in summary i need a whole wardrobe fml

1. i'm in a wonderful (and very long distance) relationship with my wonderful (although american) partner. we met online 3 years ago and have visited in person a few times

1. i go to the gym 5 days a week (when i can afford a membership), it's my happy place! i love the community + the gym fits + ARM DAY BEST DAY (don't worry i'm not a leg day skipper)

1. i think and talk about maths for fun :) i focused quite a lot on "modern algebra" at university (calculus people are my natural enemy). i do most of my maths on reddit, i also used to tutor maths

1. i think talking to people is the best thing <3 i'm really shy with new people in person, but i spend a lot of time meeting new people online. it's nice to pass time with short conversations, but actually making friends is even better!

1. i like games i guess, but i've mostly played runescape a lot lol! i love story based games, star wars kotor is very special to me (a super boring, popular opinion hehe). i played dnd with my friends ONCE (the pain of making plans as an adult...). i've been enjoying overwatch recently (specifically because i heard gender havers playing it is a thing and i wanted to try it and try to make friends!)

1. i'm a disgusting optimist and i ✨love✨ that smiling makes you happy (did you know?). my partner helps me to appreciate nature and sunlight (:
